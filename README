======================================

Yo,

This is a class for using MongoDB with CI.  This is an extreme work in 
progress.  There are a ton of features I would like to add/change so 
feel free to fork and add features.

INSTALLATION:
Just copy the files from this package to the correspoding folder in your
application folder.  Then insert the appropriate settings in the config 
file.  You will also need MongoDB setup and working with the PECL Mongo 
class.

USING MONGO_DB:
Below is sample controller code.  There is also a example model 
named Blog_model that will walk you through extending mongo_db 
with your own models.


USING EXAMPLE MODEL:

	//this would likely be auto-loaded but you can load it when needed as well
	$this->load->model('mongo_db');
	
	//load the example blog model
	$this->load->model('blog_model');
		
	//create our post (document)
	$post = array('id' => ($this->blog_model->count()+1),
				  'title' => 'test1',
				  'body' => 'blah',
				  'author' => 'ben',
				  'date' => time(),
				 );
	$this->blog_model->add_post($post);


	echo 'There are ' . $this->blog_model->count() . ' total posts:<br />';
	foreach ($this->blog_model->find() as $post) {
		print_r($post);
	}
		
	echo '<br /><br />This is the most recent post:<br />';	
	print_r($this->blog_model->find_one(array('id' => $this->blog_model->count())));


USING MONGO_DB DIRECTLY IN YOUR CONTROLLER:

	//this would likely be auto-loaded but you can load it when needed as well
	$this->load->model('mongo_db');
		
	//set which collection to use	
	$this->mongo_db->collection('posts');
		
	//add a post (document)	
	$post = array('id' => ($this->mongo_db->posts->count()+1),
				  'title' => 'test1',
				  'body' => 'blah',
				  'author' => 'ben',
				  'date' => time(),
				 );
	$this->mongo_db->posts->insert($post);


	echo 'There are ' . $this->mongo_db->posts->count() . ' total posts:<br />';
	foreach ($this->mongo_db->posts->find() as $post) {
		print_r($post);
	}
		
	echo '<br /><br />This is the most recent post:<br />';	
	print_r($this->mongo_db->find_one(array('id' => $this->mongo_db->posts->count())));





Feel free to send me an email or create an issue if you have any problems
but keep in mind this is extremely new...
